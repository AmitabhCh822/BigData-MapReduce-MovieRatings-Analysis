# Big Data MapReduce Movie Ratings Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the "BigData-MapReduce-MovieRatings-Analysis" repository. This project focuses on leveraging the power of big data processing techniques using MapReduce, implemented in Python with the mrjob library, to analyze movie ratings data.

## Project Description
This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to process and analyze large datasets of movie ratings. The primary goals of this project include:
- Counting movie ratings.
- Identifying the most popular movies based on ratings.
- Demonstrating efficient data processing methods in a big data context.

## Technical Requirements
To run these scripts, you will need:
- Python
- The mrjob library

### Installation
To set up your environment for running these scripts, follow these steps:
1. Install the latest version of Python from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the mrjob library using pip:
       pip install mrjob

## Usage
To run a MapReduce job, navigate to the script's directory and use the following command:
python <script_name.py> <input_file>
Replace `<script_name.py>` with the name of the script you want to run and `<input_file>` with the path to your data file.

## Data Format
The scripts expect input data in the following format:
- Tab-separated values with fields: userID, movieID, rating and timestamp.
